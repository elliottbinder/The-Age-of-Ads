# some_twitter_blocks

If you think it's a mistake you made it onto this list, make an issue and I'll see if I can remove you.

Here's over 2600 accounts that I block on Twitter.  Mostly promoted, meme-posting, or "parody" accounts.

To block these accounts:
1. download this csv file.
2. go to your settings on Twitter
2. click *Blocked accounts* on the left-hand sidebar
3. from the *Advanced options* drop down, select "Import a list" and select the csv that you downloaded.


If you wanna contribute, make a pull request, append your blocks, and push!
